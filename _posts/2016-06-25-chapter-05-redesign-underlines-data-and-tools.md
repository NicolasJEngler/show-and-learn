Hi there, thanks for being kind enought to tune in the fourth episode of _Show and Learn_. In this delivery we see ourselves to a whole new world of fonts, courtesy of Google and Beth Fioritto's article _What the New Google Fonts Gets Rightâ€”and Wrong_.

Then, we move on to a review of NicolÃ¡s Bevacqua's article "_Gulp, Grunt, Whatever_" that taught us that we should use what suits us best, and not what is currently in fashion on the web design industry.

We also take a look at Jonathan Neal's approach on text underlining using CSS properties like `box-shadow` and `text-shadow`, and we check the _CSS Secrets Book_ by Lea Verou to see how she approaches this technique.

To finish this episode, we take Invision's Craft for a ride to test their new update, which gave us the _Data_ plugin. _Data_ makes it super easy to pull *real data* into your designs using, for example, an API.

**Editor's note**: I realized I said "his" when speaking about Lea, and that I've been mispronouncing NicolÃ¡s' last name, sorry about that ðŸ˜ž
