As Frank Herbert said «_There is no real ending. It’s just the place where you stop the story_». Eventually, all things end, and at the time of writing of this post, it is the case for the _Show and Learn_ podcast.

First of all, let me say how grateful I am that you've allowed me to enter your lives, **I had nothing but absolute fun doing this** podcast series, and I have learned so much about both activities, podcasting and front-end development/design. I hope the feeling is mutual and you've enjoyed listening to these short episodes as much as I enjoyed producing them.

Sadly, **the main reason why I'm stopping the podcast is because my schedule does not allow me to take the time to record anymore**, and I believe it is better to pull the plug rather than leave it hanging on some sort of limbo. The last episode was recorded a few months ago, and I have a couple of other episodes that weren't published, they could be released but I don't think they're polished enough to be out there, so I'd rather to keep those to myself.

I'll keep a backup copy of the podcast on [Github][showandlearn-gh-pages], so there's a record of this when the hosting/domain stops working.

Until next time, and once again...

### Thank you
