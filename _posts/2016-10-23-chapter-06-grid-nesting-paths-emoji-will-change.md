Hey there, thanks for tuning the sixth episode of _Show and Learn_. In this episode we talk about a pretty wide set of stuff, so let's dig in!

_126Kr_ revises the status of the *CSS Grid Layout Module*, talks about the different states a draft could be in, and dives into the future of this implementation.

After talking about the *Grid Layout Module*, we have _Martin Wolf_ showing us how we can *nest properties* in Sass, which is great given that I'm pretty sure not much people is aware of this.

Moving on, we have _Chris Coyier_ tweeting a demo where we can see how an SVG path is manipulated using the `d` property in CSS. This is rather shaky, yet interesting, territory!

And then we can see _Guillermo Rauch_ and _@mahemoff_ playing around with CSS `text-shadows` in order to get emoji silhouettes and outlines ðŸ™Š.

Finally, we go through a post created by the folks at _GreenSock_ talking about the `will-change` property bug introduced with Chrome 53, and how you can deal with it.


**Editor's note**: I may have said "article" instead of "episode" at the ending, excuse my momentary brainfart ðŸ˜….
