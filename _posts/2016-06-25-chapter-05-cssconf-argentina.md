After a hiatus of over 30 days, welcome back and thanks for tuning the fifth episode of _Show and Learn_. In this delivery we recap the whole CSSconf Argentina event that took place in Buenos Aires on August 7 2016, at the Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini.

There were a ton of attendees, great speakers, and amazing talks. Feel free to check out their site, I'll leave a link below, next to the speakers and organizers' twitter handles and/or websites.

The episode goes through each and every one of the talks that were given, along with some extra information, and I share some of my personal experience and what this conference meant to me. I had a blast!

**Editor's note**: I know I may seem tired in this episode, and I apologize for that. These last months have been completely bonkers for me, and I my lifestyle changed overnight. Hopefully, soon enought I'll be able to go back to a more normal frequency to ship new episodes.
