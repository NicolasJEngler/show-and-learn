Hey everyone, thanks for tuning in the second episode of _Show and Learn_. In this episode we jump rather abruptly in between subjects. We talk a handful of UI, UX, CSS; and, drumroll please, *automation*.

Let's go bit by bit. First we have a post by Chris Coyier discussing how to style the HTML `pre` tag using only CSS and how to combine it with the `code` tag.
Then we have Jehan Fillat showing us how to automate CMS and frameworks installations using Vagrant. Vagrant is a tool to create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable, development environments.
Moving on we have Vince Speelman diving into the different states of design, he shows us how to make each state of our UI amazing no matter how little information we have to display.
And finally we have George Martsoukos shedding some light on how `z-index` affects a flexbox layout.

I apologize in advanced for the amount of times I said "_you know_" in this episode ðŸ˜³
